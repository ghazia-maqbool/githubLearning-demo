# githubLearning-demo
<h1>GITHUB learning from apnacollege</h1>
<p>In this i have learnt how to create github account, how to create repositories(while creating repo we will add readme file which is a good approach).readmefile have md which stand for markdown.</p>
Initial commit against readme file means that we have first change in our file (it means we create a repo and first thing we did is to add a readme file in our repo).
<br>
Changes in this are commit.<br> 
When we make a change in our code or files first we add it and then we have to commit it(change is added to file(final)).In Github the add step is skiped and directly we commmit our changes.<br>
Github save our history while saving commits.<br>
After changing or commit changes we don't have initial commit it will be updated readme.<br>
To write readme more betterly we use basics of html.<br>
